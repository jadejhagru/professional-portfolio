Professional Portfolio

**Hello World!**

My name is Jade,
 
This is my professional portfolio.
I am new and upcoming front-end developer who is passionate about design and creating new compositions. 
A little background about me, I have been in the design industry for 7+ years. After some time, I really started to feel like I wantedto do something a little more with my life and somehting that'll challenge me and make me work harder.
I knew once I was introduced to coding, it became something that could open so many doors and opportunities for me.
I know I have so much to learn but I am beyond willing to keep tackling every challange and overcoming any bumps along the way... and most importantly, expanding my knowledge.

My portfolio has been built with HTML and Advanced CSS & I have added puesdo-classes and media queries as well so it is compatible with various devices.
Below is screetshots of my portfolio followed by the wireframing that I did prior to creating my portfolio so you can see how I've executed my ideas.
